Use Flutter and Dart to build an app with the following primary functions:
● Search bar, where you can enter some name and search real github repositories.
● By clicking the repo show info about it
● Add FAB, by clicking on it - show UI where you can create your own repo
○ Add new repo to the list on repositories
● On the details page, if it's your fake repo, allow the user to edit it
